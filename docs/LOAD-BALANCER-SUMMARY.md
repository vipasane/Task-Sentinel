## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Balancing Strategies

#### Round Robin
- Simple rotation through workers
- Fair distribution for homogeneous tasks
- Zero overhead

#### Least Loaded
- Assigns to worker with lowest current load
- Prevents overload situations
- Good for general workloads

#### Capability Based
- Matches task requirements to worker skills
- Optimizes for specialization
- Scores based on capability overlap

#### Performance Based
- Uses historical metrics for selection
- Considers success rate, speed, reliability
- Ideal for critical workloads

#### Adaptive
- Combines all strategies with dynamic weights
- Learns optimal distribution patterns
- Adjusts weights based on feedback

### 2. Worker Scoring System

Comprehensive 4-factor scoring:

```typescript
score = (
  0.4 * capacityScore +      // Available capacity
  0.3 * performanceScore +   // Historical success rate
  0.2 * affinityScore +      // Task-worker affinity
  0.1 * reliabilityScore     // Speed + uptime
)
```

Each factor is independently calculated and weighted for optimal selection.

### 3. Affinity Rules

**Task Affinity (Sticky Workers)**
- Prefer specific workers for related tasks
- Useful for stateful operations
- Session continuity

**Anti-Affinity**
- Avoid problematic workers
- Recent failure avoidance
- Resource conflict prevention

**Context-Based Affinity**
- Historical task assignments
- Worker specialization tracking
- Dynamic affinity learning

### 4. Dynamic Rebalancing

**Overload Detection**
- Monitors worker capacity usage
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Configurable load thresholds (default: 80%)

**Task Migration Recommendations**
- Analyzes load variance across workers
- Suggests optimal migrations
- Priority-based recommendations

**Queue Reordering**
- Optimizes task order for efficiency
- Pre-assigns workers to queued tasks
- Balances priority with availability

### 5. Integration Points

**WorkerRegistry Integration**
```typescript
// Get workers from registry
const workers = workerRegistry.getAll().map(w => ({
  id: w.id,
  capabilities: w.capabilities,
  maxCapacity: w.maxTasks,
  currentLoad: w.activeTasks.size,
  status: w.status,
  metrics: w.metrics
}));

// Select and assign
const worker = loadBalancer.selectWorker(task, workers);
```

**GOAP Integration**
```typescript
// Use task complexity from GOAP planner
const task: TaskRequirements = {
  capabilities: goal.requiredCapabilities,
  complexity: action.cost,
  priority: goal.priority,
  estimatedDuration: action.estimatedDuration
};
```

**Metrics Integration**
```typescript
// Update context after task completion
loadBalancer.updateContext(
  workerId,
  taskType,
  success,
  duration
);
```

## Algorithm Details

### Worker Selection Algorithm

```typescript
selectWorker(task, workers) {
  // 1. Filter by required capabilities
  const capable = filterByCapabilities(workers, task.capabilities);

  // 2. Filter by available capacity
  const available = filterByCapacity(capable, task.complexity);

  // 3. Apply affinity/anti-affinity rules
  const filtered = applyAffinityRules(available, task);

  // 4. Use strategy to select best
  return strategy.selectWorker(filtered, task, context);
}
```

### Adaptive Strategy Learning

```typescript
// Update weights based on task outcomes
updateWeights(strategyName, success) {
  // Track successes and failures
  history[strategyName][success ? 'successes' : 'failures']++;

  // Rebalance weights proportionally
  for (strategy in strategies) {
    successRate = history[strategy].successes / total;
    weight[strategy] = successRate / sumSuccessRates;
  }
}
```

### Overload Detection

```typescript
detectOverload(workers) {
  const overloaded = workers.filter(w =>
    w.currentLoad / w.maxCapacity > loadThreshold
  );

  const underutilized = workers.filter(w =>
    w.currentLoad / w.maxCapacity < 0.3
  );

  return generateMigrationRecommendations(overloaded, underutilized);
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **Round Robin**: O(n) - single pass through workers
- **Least Loaded**: O(n log n) - sorting by load
- **Capability Based**: O(n Ã— m) - n workers, m capabilities
- **Performance Based**: O(n) - single scoring pass
- **Adaptive**: O(n Ã— s) - n workers, s strategies

### Space Complexity

- Worker info storage: O(n) - n workers
- Task history: O(n Ã— t) - n workers, t task types
- Strategy weights: O(s) - s strategies
- Context maps: O(n) - linear with workers

### Scalability

- Supports 1000+ workers efficiently
- Constant-time strategy switching
- Incremental context updates
- Memory-efficient scoring

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Distribution

```typescript
import { LoadBalancer } from './src/distributed/load-balancer';

const loadBalancer = new LoadBalancer();

const task = {
  capabilities: ['typescript', 'testing'],
  complexity: 5,
  priority: 7
};

const worker = loadBalancer.selectWorker(task, workers);
```

### Strategy Switching

```typescript
// Start with adaptive
loadBalancer.setStrategy('adaptive');

// Switch to performance-based for critical tasks
if (task.priority > 8) {
  loadBalancer.setStrategy('performance-based');
}
```

### Monitoring and Rebalancing

```typescript
// Detect overload
const overload = loadBalancer.detectOverload(workers);
if (overload.length > 0) {
  console.log('Workers overloaded:', overload);
}

// Suggest migrations
const migrations = loadBalancer.suggestMigration(workers, taskQueue);
if (migrations.length > 0) {
  console.log('Rebalancing recommended');
}
```

### Worker Affinity

```typescript
const task = {
  capabilities: ['ml', 'tensorflow'],
  complexity: 10,
  priority: 9,
  affinity: ['worker-gpu-1'],
  antiAffinity: ['worker-failed']
};
```
